# Donsider
This is a "Project planning" application that I've nbeen messing around with. What I hoped to learn while working on this project was a firm grasp on functional components in React, id base routing in React, using mongoose as an ODM, connecting to AWS S3 buckets and service resources from AWS Cloudfront CDN.

This project was relies on a backend "api" [I've built using node/mongodb](https://github.com/SDRandal/donsider-backend). 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`
